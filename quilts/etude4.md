# Etude 4 Submission - donan928 2169260
This submission is regarding the Quilting Bee problem.
To compile and run in the terminal:

javac Quilts.java

java Quilts <input.txt

OR (for optional shape)

java Quilts <input.txt {}
java Quilts {} <input.txt

{'s'} for square
{'t'} for triangle
{'f'} for flipped triangle

# upgrade

I've implemented a feature that allows the quilt patterns to also display triangles instead of just squares. To achieve this, the shape must be stated in the terminal arguement. Examples are described below


# input examples

java Quilts input.txt s
java Quilts input.txt t
java Quilts input.txt f
